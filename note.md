## Record some issue I met in git

1. I couldn't upload the file I changed on Feb.26th

The reason is I change the readme file in the github. so it is different between the github and my local file.
so I need to pull the different change fron the github.
The command I use `git pull origin master`, then i can upload the file I add locally.
